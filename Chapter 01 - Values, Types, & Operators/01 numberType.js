//JS stores numbers using a fixed number of bits, i.e., 64.
//one of such bits is reserved to determine whether a number is negative, & a few more are reserved for details regarding floating numbers.
//a JS number type can store a number upto ~ 09 quadrillion.
//Here's the syntax:

let int = 1;
let float = 1.2;
let exponent = 2.3e8; //i.e., (2.3 * (10^8)) = 230,000,000...


//Some NOTES:
//01. In most programming languages, Integers are stored precisely, but floats are not. They're approximate value at best. This should be kept in mind.
