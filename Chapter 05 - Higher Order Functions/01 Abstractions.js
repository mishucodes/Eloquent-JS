//01. Abstractions: That which gives us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or more abstract) level, without getting sidetracked by uninteresting details.
//As an analogy, compare these two recipes for pea soup. The first goes like this:
    //"Put 1 cup of dried peas per person into a container. Add water until the peas are well covered. Leave the peas in water for at least 12 hours. Take the peas out of the water and put them in a cooking pan. Add 4 cups of water per person. Cover the pan and keep the peas simmering for two hours. Take half an onion per person. Cut it into pieces with a knife. Add it to the peas. Take a stalk of celery per person. Cut it into pieces with a knife. Add it to the peas. Take a carrot per person. Cut it into pieces. With a knife! Add it to the peas. Cook for 10 more minutes."
//And this is the second recipe:
    //"Per person: 1 cup dried split peas, 4 cups of water, half a chopped onion, a stalk of celery, and a carrot. SOAK peas for 12 hours. SIMMER for 2 hours. CHOP and add VEGETABLES. Cook for 10 more minutes." (Capitalised words are abstractions)...

//AUTHOR SAYS: When programming, we might fall into the pattern of the first recipe. We write precise instructions to the computer one-by-one, blind to the higher-level concepts they express. It is a useful skill, in programming, to notice when you are working at too low a level of abstraction.
