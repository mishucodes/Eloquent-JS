//Local Storage: The "localStorage" object can be used to store data in a way that survives page reloads. This object allows you to file string values under names. For Example:
    localStorage.setItem("username", "worldofmishu");
    localStorage.getItem("username");
    localStorage.removeItem("username");

//Sessions Storage: Same but it's cleared as soon as the window is closed.
