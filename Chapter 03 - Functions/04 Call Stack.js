//Call Stack: The call stack is a way of keeping track of function execution. Each new function call gets pushed onto a 'stack'. Once it finishes, it’s popped off. This push-pop cycle ensures functions return in the correct order, handling nested and recursive calls reliably during program execution. For instance:
function greet(who)
{
    console.log("Hello " + who);
}
greet("Harry");
console.log("Bye");
//A run through this program goes roughly like this: the call to greet causes control to jump to the start of that function (line 4). The function calls console.log, which takes control, does its job, and then returns control to line 4. There, it reaches the end of the greet function, so it returns to the place that called it — line 6. The line after that calls console.log again. After that returns, the program reaches its end.

//NOTE: The stack is a limited amount of memory (at least in 2025's consumer tech), so it is possible to overflow it.
