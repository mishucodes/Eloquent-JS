Socrates wandered Athens like a friendly intellectual mosquito, irritating everyone into thinking harder. He wrote nothing, which is either philosophical purity or the greatest academic dodge in history. His method was simple and ruthless: ask questions until confident people realised they didn’t know what they thought they knew. Wisdom, for him, began with admitting ignorance. This made him popular with students and deeply unpopular with authorities. Athens eventually sentenced him to death for corrupting the youth, a charge that still feels ironic. By calmly drinking hemlock, Socrates turned philosophy into a lived commitment rather than a profession.
