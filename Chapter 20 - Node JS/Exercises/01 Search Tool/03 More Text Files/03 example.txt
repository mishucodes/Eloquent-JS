Aristotle was Plato’s student and his great dissenter. Where Plato looked upward to abstract ideals, Aristotle looked outward at plants, animals, politics, and poetry. He wanted to catalogue reality, not escape it. He believed knowledge begins with observation, which quietly laid the groundwork for science. Aristotle thought happiness came from cultivating virtue through habit, not divine inspiration or sudden insight. He wrote on logic, ethics, biology, drama, and governance with alarming confidence. His influence dominated medieval thought for centuries. If Plato dreamed, Aristotle measured, labelled, and cross-referenced the dream.
