René Descartes decided the safest place to start philosophy was absolute doubt. He stripped away everything that could possibly be false until he hit bedrock: I think, therefore I am. That single thought proved the thinker’s existence, even if the world was an illusion. Descartes split reality into mind and matter, birthing modern dualism and centuries of headaches. He also helped invent analytic geometry, proving philosophers can do maths without collapsing. His method prized clarity and certainty, like a philosophical clean room. Modern rationalism, for better and worse, begins with his relentless suspicion.
