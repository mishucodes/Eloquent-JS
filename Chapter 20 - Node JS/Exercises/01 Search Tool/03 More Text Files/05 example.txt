John Calvin was less interested in questioning everything and more interested in organising belief with iron logic. A central figure of the Protestant Reformation, he believed God’s sovereignty ruled every aspect of existence. His doctrine of predestination claimed salvation was decided by God alone, not human effort, which comforted some and terrified others. Calvin emphasised discipline, moral seriousness, and communal order. In Geneva, his ideas shaped not just theology but daily life. Critics call his system harsh; admirers call it coherent and God-centred. Calvin’s legacy still echoes in Protestant ethics and cultural attitudes toward work and duty.
