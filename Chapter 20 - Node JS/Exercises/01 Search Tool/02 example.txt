Plato took Socrates’ questions and built a whole metaphysical skyline on top of them. He believed the world we see is a shadow-play, with true reality existing in perfect, abstract Forms. Chairs decay, but “Chairness” is eternal. Plato’s dialogues read like philosophical theatre, with Socrates often cast as the star. He distrusted democracy after watching Athens execute his teacher, and preferred rule by philosopher-kings—wise, educated, and dangerously convinced they know best. Plato founded the Academy, making philosophy institutional for the first time. Western philosophy, as people like to say, is footnotes to him.
